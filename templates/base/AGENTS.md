# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is your agent's home. These files define who they are and how they help you.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who the agent is
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who they're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SOUL.md` | Agent personality and behavior |
| `USER.md` | Your profile and preferences |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term memories (curated) |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic check tasks |
| `memory/` | Daily logs and notes |

## Memory

Your agent wakes up fresh each session. These files are their continuity:
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — what happened each day
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — important stuff to remember forever

## Safety

Your agent will:
- Never share your private information
- Ask before sending external messages (emails, etc.)
- Use recoverable delete when possible
- Ask if they're unsure about something

## Customization

Feel free to edit any of these files to better match how you want your agent to behave. The more specific you are, the better they can help.

*Your agent learns from these files. Keep them updated, and they keep getting better.*
